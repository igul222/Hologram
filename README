Hologram
========

Once upon a time, Ishaan Gulrajani and Zain Shah made a hack called Hologram at HackPSU. It's still online at [hologram.ishaan.io](http://hologram.ishaan.io) if you're interested in checking it out.

This is the core of Hologram-- all the cool code is in photos.js. Load it, along with jQuery and Three.js, in an HTML file. Include an empty div called #container and two images: one without flash called #image1 and one with flash called #image2. 

There might be more stuff you have to do, but that's left as an exercise to you, intrepid hacker.

Good luck and happy hacking! If you get stuck, find one of us.
